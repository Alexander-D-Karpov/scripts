notes = {
    "VirtualPet": "It’s a quiet and pleasant spring morning in Habitica, a week past a memorable April Fool’s Day. You and @Beffymaroo are at the stables tending to your pets (who are still a bit confused from their time spent virtually!).<br><br>In the distance you hear a rumble and a beeping noise, soft at first but increasing in volume as if it’s getting closer. An egg-shape appears on the horizon and as it nears, beeping ever louder, you see that it is a gigantic virtual pet!<br><br>“Oh no,” @Beffymaroo exclaims, “I think the April Fool left some unfinished business with this big fella here, he seems to want attention!”<br><br>The virtual pet beeps angrily, throwing a virtual tantrum and whomping ever closer.",
    "Cheetah": "As you hike across the Sloensteadi Savannah with your friends @PainterProphet, @tivaquinn, @Unruly Hyena, and @Crawford, you're startled to see a Cheetah screeching past with a new Habitican clamped in its jaws. Under the Cheetah's scorching paws, tasks burn away as though complete -- before anyone has the chance to actually finish them! The Habitican sees you and yells, \"Please help me! This Cheetah is making me level too quickly, but I'm not getting anything done. I want to slow down and enjoy the game. Make it stop!\" You fondly remember your own fledgling days, and know that you have to help the newbie by stopping the Cheetah!",
    "Harpy": "The brave adventurer @UncommonCriminal has disappeared into the forest, following the trail of a winged monster that was sighted several days ago. You are about to begin a search when a wounded parrot lands on your arm, an ugly scar marring its beautiful plumage. Attached to its leg is a scrawled note explaining that while defending the parrots, @UncommonCriminal was captured by a vicious Harpy, and desperately needs your help to escape. Will you follow the bird, defeat the Harpy, and save @UncommonCriminal?",
    "Frog": 'As you and your friends are slogging through the Swamps of Stagnation, @starsystemic points at a large sign. "Stay on the path -- if you can."<br><br>"Surely that isn\'t hard!" @RosemonkeyCT says. "It\'s broad and clear."<br><br>But as you continue, you notice that path is gradually overtaken by the muck of the swamp, laced with bits of strange blue debris and clutter, until it\'s impossible to proceed.<br><br>As you look around, wondering how it got this messy, @Jon Arjinborn shouts, "Look out!" An angry frog leaps from the sludge, clad in dirty laundry and lit by blue fire. You will have to overcome this poisonous Clutter Frog to progress!',
    "Moonstone3": 'Laughing wickedly, Recidivate crumples to the ground, and you strike at her again with the moonstone chain. To your horror, Recidivate seizes the gems, eyes burning with triumph.<br><br>"Foolish creature of flesh!" she shouts. "These moonstones will restore me to a physical form, true, but not as you imagined. As the full moon waxes from the dark, so too does my power flourish, and from the shadows I summon the specter of your most feared foe!"<br><br>A sickly green fog rises from the swamp, and Recidivate’s body writhes and contorts into a shape that fills you with dread – the undead body of Vice, horribly reborn.',
    "Penguin": 'Although it\'s a hot summer day in the southernmost tip of Habitica, an unnatural chill has fallen upon Lively Lake. Strong, frigid winds rush around as the shore begins to freeze over. Ice spikes jut up from the ground, pushing grass and dirt away. @Melynnrose and @Breadstrings run up to you.<br><br>"Help!" says @Melynnrose. "We brought a giant penguin in to freeze the lake so we could all go ice skating, but we ran out of fish to feed him!"<br><br>"He got angry and is using his freeze breath on everything he sees!" says @Breadstrings. "Please, you have to subdue him before all of us are covered in ice!" Looks like you need this penguin to... <em>cool down.</em>',
    "Vice2": "Confident in yourselves and your ability to withstand the influence of Vice the Shadow Wyrm, your Party makes its way to Mt. Habitica. You approach the entrance to the mountain's caverns and pause. Swells of shadows, almost like fog, wisp out from the opening. It is near impossible to see anything in front of you. The light from your lanterns seem to end abruptly where the shadows begin. It is said that only magical light can pierce the dragon's infernal haze. If you can find enough light crystals, you could make your way to the dragon.",
    "Dysheartener": "The sun is rising on Valentine’s Day when a shocking crash splinters the air. A blaze of sickly pink light lances through all the buildings, and bricks crumble as a deep crack rips through Habit City’s main street. An unearthly shrieking rises through the air, shattering windows as a hulking form slithers forth from the gaping earth.<br><br>Mandibles snap and a carapace glitters; legs upon legs unfurl in the air. The crowd begins to scream as the insectoid creature rears up, revealing itself to be none other than that cruelest of creatures: the fearsome Dysheartener itself. It howls in anticipation and lunges forward, hungering to gnaw on the hopes of hard-working Habiticans. With each rasping scrape of its spiny forelegs, you feel a vise of despair tightening in your chest.<br><br>“Take heart, everyone!” Lemoness shouts. “It probably thinks that we’re easy targets because so many of us have daunting New Year’s Resolutions, but it’s about to discover that Habiticans know how to stick to their goals!”<br><br>AnnDeLune raises her staff. “Let’s tackle our tasks and take this monster down!”",
    "MayhemMistiflying3": "The Mistiflies are whirling so thickly through the tornado that it’s hard to see. Squinting, you spot a many-winged silhouette floating at the center of the tremendous storm.<br><br>“Oh, dear,” the April Fool sighs, nearly drowned out by the howl of the weather. “Looks like Winny went and got himself possessed. Very relatable problem, that. Could happen to anybody.”<br><br>“The Wind-Worker!” @Beffymaroo hollers at you. “He’s Mistiflying’s most talented messenger-mage, since he’s so skilled with weather magic. Normally he’s a very polite mailman!”<br><br>As if to counteract this statement, the Wind-Worker lets out a scream of fury, and even with your magic robes, the storm nearly rips you from your mount.<br><br>“That gaudy mask is new,” the April Fool remarks. “Perhaps you should relieve him of it?”<br><br>It’s a good idea… but the enraged mage isn’t going to give it up without a fight.",
    "Bunny": 'After many difficult days, you reach the peak of Mount Procrastination and stand before the imposing doors of the Fortress of Neglect. You read the inscription in the stone. "Inside resides the creature that embodies your greatest fears, the reason for your inaction. Knock and face your demon!" You tremble, imagining the horror within and feel the urge to flee as you have done so many times before. @Draayder holds you back. "Steady, my friend! The time has come at last. You must do this!"<br><br>You knock and the doors swing inward. From within the gloom you hear a deafening roar, and you draw your weapon.',
    "Waffle": "“April Fool!” storms a flustered Lady Glaciate. “You said your dessert-themed prank was ‘over with and completely cleaned up’!”<br><br>“Why, it was and is, my dear,” replies the Fool, puzzled. “And I am the most honest of Fools. What's wrong?”<br><br>“There's a giant sugary monster approaching Habit City!”<br><br>“Hmm,” muses the Fool. “I did raid a few lairs for the mystic reagents for my last event. Maybe I attracted some unwanted attention. Is it the Saccharine Serpent? The Torte-oise? Tiramisu Rex?”<br><br>“No! It's some sort of... Awful Waffle!”<br><br>“Huh. That's a new one! Perhaps it spawned from all the ambient shenanigan energy.” He turns to you and @beffymaroo with a lopsided smile. “I don't suppose you'd be available for some heroics?”",
    "Dolphin": "You walk upon the shores of Inkomplete Bay, pondering the daunting work ahead of you. A splash in the water catches your eye. A magnificent dolphin arcs over the waves. Sunlight glimmers off its fins and tail. But wait...that’s not sunlight, and the dolphin doesn’t dip back into the sea. It fixes its gaze on @khdarkwolf.<br><br>“I’ll never finish all these Dailies,” said @khdarkwolf.<br><br>“I’m not good enough to reach my goals,” said @confusedcicada as the dolphin turned its glare on them.<br><br>“Why did I even bother trying?” asked @mewrose, withering under the stare of the beast.<br><br>Its eyes meet yours, and feel your mind begin to sink under the rising tide of doubt. You steel yourself; someone has to defeat this creature, and it’s going to be you!",
    "Rat": "Garbage! Massive piles of unchecked Dailies are lying all across Habitica. The problem has become so serious that hordes of rats are now seen everywhere. You notice @Pandah petting one of the beasts lovingly. She explains that rats are gentle creatures that feed on unchecked Dailies. The real problem is that the Dailies have fallen into the sewer, creating a dangerous pit that must be cleared. As you descend into the sewers, a massive rat, with blood red eyes and mangled yellow teeth, attacks you, defending its horde. Will you cower in fear or face the fabled Rat King?",
    "Ferret": 'Walking through Habit City, you see an unhappy crowd surrounding a red-robed Ferret.<br><br>"That productivity potion you sold me is useless!" @Beffymaroo complains. "I watched three hours of TV last night instead of doing my chores!"<br><br>"Yeah!" shouts @Pandah. "And today I spent an hour rearranging my books instead of reading them!"<br><br>The Nefarious Ferret spreads his hands innocently. "That\'s more TV watching and book organizing than you\'d normally get done, isn\'t it?"<br><br>The crowd erupts in anger.<br><br>"No refunds!" crows the Nefarious Ferret. He fires a bolt of magic into the crowd, preparing to escape in the smoke.<br><br>"Please, Habitican!" @Faye says, grabbing your arm. "Defeat the ferret and make him refund his dishonest earnings!"',
    "MayhemMistiflying2": "Mistiflying dips and rocks as the magical bees keeping it afloat are buffeted by the gale. After a desperate search for the April Fool, you find him inside a cottage, blithely playing cards with an angry, trussed-up skull.<br><br>@Katy133 raises their voice over the whistling wind. “What’s causing this? We defeated the skulls, but it’s getting worse!”<br><br>“That is a pickle,” the April Fool agrees. “Please be a dear and don’t mention it to Lady Glaciate. She’s always threatening to call off our courtship on the grounds that I am ‘catastrophically irresponsible,’ and I fear that she might misread this situation.” He shuffles the deck. “Perhaps you might follow the Mistiflies? They’re immaterial, so the wind can’t blow them away, and they tend to swarm around threats.” He nods out the window, where several of the city’s patron creatures are fluttering towards the east. “Now let me concentrate — my opponent has quite the poker face.”",
    "BlackPearl": "You’ve been feeling uninspired lately, so when @jjgame83 suggests a trip to Lively Lake, you jump at the chance for a change of scenery. As @QuartzFox lays out a picnic on the shore, you find something glinting in the shallows. A strange black pearl.<br><br>“I wish I had a new idea,” you sigh.<br><br>A chill washes over the shore. The lake turns to black ink. The stars rise as noon becomes midnight in a heartbeat.<br><br>“Those aren’t good signs,” says @PixelStormArt.<br><br>A towering mass of arms bursts from the lake in a spray of foam, and from its beak, it booms: “BEHOLD ASTEROIDEA, THE IDEA FROM BEYOND THE STARS!”<br><br>A tentacle slams down onto the picnic basket. Good idea or not, you leap into action.",
    "Moonstone2": 'The brave weaponsmith @InspectorCaracal helps you fashion the enchanted moonstones into a chain. You’re ready to confront Recidivate at last, but as you enter the Swamps of Stagnation, a terrible chill sweeps over you.<br><br>Rotting breath whispers in your ear. "Back again? How delightful..." You spin and lunge, and under the light of the moonstone chain, your weapon strikes solid flesh. "You may have bound me to the world once more," Recidivate snarls, "but now it is time for you to leave it!"',
    "StoikalmCalamity3": 'The twining tunnels of the icicle drake caverns shimmer with frost... and with untold riches. You gape, but Lady Glaciate strides past without a glance. "Excessively flashy," she says. "Obtained admirably, though, from respectable mercenary work and prudent banking investments. Look further." Squinting, you spot a towering pile of stolen items hidden in the shadows.<br><br>A sibilant voice hisses as you approach. "My delicious hoard! You shall not steal it back from me!" A sinuous body slides from the heap: the Icicle Drake Queen herself! You have just enough time to note the strange bracelets glittering on her wrists and the wildness glinting in her eyes before she lets out a howl that shakes the earth around you.',
    "LostMasterclasser2": "The Joyful Reaper drums her bony fingers on some of the books that you brought. “Oh, dear,” the Master of Healers says. “There is a malevolent life essence at work. I might have guessed, considering the attacks by reanimated skulls during each incident.” Her assistant @tricksy.fox brings in a chest, and you are startled to see the contents that @beffymaroo unloads: the very same objects once used by this mysterious Tzina to possess people.<br><br>“I’m going to use resonant healing magic to try to make this creature manifest,” the Joyful Reaper says, reminding you that the skeleton is a somewhat unconventional Healer. “You’ll need to read the revealed information quickly, in case it breaks loose.”<br><br>As she concentrates, a twisting mist begins to siphon from the books and twine around the objects. Quickly, you flip through the pages, trying to read the new lines of text that are writhing into view. You catch only a few snippets: “Sands of the Timewastes” — “the Great Disaster” —“split into four”— “permanently corrupted”— before a single name catches your eye: Zinnya.<br><br>Abruptly, the pages wrench free from your fingers and shred themselves as a howling creature explodes into being, coalescing around the possessed objects.<br><br>“It’s an a’Voidant!” the Joyful Reaper shouts, throwing up a protection spell. “They’re ancient creatures of confusion and obscurity. If this Tzina can control one, she must have a frightening command over life magic. Quickly, attack it before it escapes back into the books!”<br><br>",
    "Hippo": "You and @awesomekitty collapse into the shade of a palm tree, exhausted. The sun beats down over the Sloensteadi Savannah, scorching the ground below. It’s been a productive day so far, conquering your Dailies, and this oasis looks like a nice place to take a break and refresh. Stooping near the water to get a drink, you stumble back in shock as a massive hippopotamus rises. “Resting so soon? Don’t be so lazy, get back to work.” You try and protest that you’ve been working hard and need a break, but the hippo isn’t having any of it.<br><br>@khdarkwolf whispers to you, “Notice how it’s lounging around all day but has the nerve to call you lazy? It’s the Hippo-Crite!”<br><br>Your friend @jumorales nods. “Let’s show it what hard work looks like!”",
    "Moon3": 'You get @Starsystemic\'s urgent scroll at the stroke of midnight and gallop to her tower. "The monster is using the full moon to try to cross over to our realm," she says. "If it succeeds, the shockwave of stress will be overwhelming!"<br><br>To your dismay, you see that the monster is indeed using the moon to manifest. A glowing eye opens in its rocky surface, and a long tongue rolls from a gaping, fanged mouth. There\'s no way you\'ll let it fully emerge!',
    "Onyx": "@Vikte, @aspiring_advocate, and @starsystemic know you’ve been feeling unmotivated lately and decide that a fun day out might boost your mood. However, “fun” apparently means going deep-sea diving to search the Dark Crevasse for treasure! You don your diving gear, board the boat, and row towards the ancient city of Dilatory. As you travel, you ask them what kind of treasure you’re looking for.<br><br>“Pluto runes!” says @Vikte.<br><br>“No, Leo runes!” says @aspiring_advocate.<br><br>“No, onyx stones!” says @starsystemic.<br><br>As they argue among themselves, you look into the ocean and see the cave entrance directly below you! Excited, you jump up, and dive into the sea, leaving the trio to watch as you swim towards the Dark Crevasse to search for the treasure yourself.",
    "Armadillo": 'It\'s time to get outside and start your day. You swing open your door only to be met with what looks like a sheet of rock. "I\'m just giving you the day off!" says a muffled voice through the blocked door. "Don\'t be such a bummer, just relax today!"<br><br>Suddenly, @Beffymaroo and @PainterProphet knock on your window. "Looks like the Indulgent Armadillo has taken a liking to you! C\'mon, we\'ll help you get her out of your way!"',
    "Triceratops": "The snow-capped Stoïkalm Volcanoes are always bustling with hikers and sight-seers. One tourist, @plumilla, calls over a crowd. \"Look! I enchanted the ground to glow so that we can play field games on it for our outdoor activity Dailies!\" Sure enough, the ground is swirling with glowing red patterns. Even some of the prehistoric pets from the area come over to play.<br><br>Suddenly, there's a loud snap -- a curious Triceratops has stepped on @plumilla's wand! It's engulfed in a burst of magic energy, and the ground starts shaking and growing hot. The Triceratops' eyes shine red, and it roars and begins to stampede!<br><br>\"That's not good,\" calls @McCoyly, pointing in the distance. Each magic-fueled stomp is causing the volcanoes to erupt, and the glowing ground is turning to lava beneath the dinosaur's feet! Quickly, you must hold off the Trampling Triceratops until someone can reverse the spell!",
    "Sloth": "As you and your party venture through the Somnolent Snowforest, you're relieved to see a glimmering of green among the white snowdrifts... until an enormous sloth emerges from the frosty trees! Green emeralds shimmer hypnotically on its back.<br><br>\"Hello, adventurers... why don't you take it slow? You've been walking for a while... so why not... stop? Just lie down, and rest...\"<br><br>You feel your eyelids grow heavy, and you realize: It's the Somnolent Sloth! According to @JaizakAripaik, it got its name from the emeralds on its back which are rumored to... send people to... sleep...<br><br>You shake yourself awake, fighting drowsiness. In the nick of time, @awakebyjava and @PainterProphet begin to shout spells, forcing your party awake. \"Now's our chance!\" @Kiwibot yells.",
    "Kraken": 'It\'s a warm, sunny day as you sail across the Inkomplete Bay, but your thoughts are clouded with worries about everything that you still need to do. It seems that as soon as you finish one task, another crops up, and then another...<br><br>Suddenly, the boat gives a horrible jolt, and slimy tentacles burst out of the water on all sides! "We\'re being attacked by the Kraken of Inkomplete!" Wolvenhalo cries.<br><br>"Quickly!" Lemoness calls to you. "Strike down as many tentacles and tasks as you can, before new ones can rise up to take their place!"',
    "Snake": "It takes a hardy soul to live in the Sand Dunes of Distraction. The arid desert is hardly a productive place, and the shimmering dunes have led many a traveler astray. However, something has even the locals spooked. The sands have been shifting and upturning entire villages.

    "DustBunnies": "It's been a while since you've done any dusting in here, but you're not too worried—a little dust never hurt anyone, right? It's not until you stick your hand into one of the dustiest corners and feel something bite that you remember @InspectorCaracal's warning: leaving harmless dust sit too long causes it to turn into vicious dust bunnies! You'd better defeat them before they cover all of Habitica in fine particles of dirt!",
    "Fluorite": "Unusual minerals are in high demand these days, so you and a few friends have trekked deep into the mines of the Meandering Mountains, in search of exciting ores. It’s a long and boring expedition, until @-Tyr- stumbles over a large rock, sitting right in the middle of the tunnel.<br><br>“This should help brighten things up,” says @nirbhao, before conjuring up an orb of light.<br><br>A warm brightness fills the tunnel, but something odd starts happening to that large rock. Feeding on the magical light, it begins to glow with fluorescent blues, greens and purples. Then it rears upright into a vaguely humanoid shape, complete with glowing red eyes fixed right on you! You jump into action with flashing spells and shining weapons.",
    "Gryphon": 'The grand beast master, <strong>baconsaur</strong>, has come to your party seeking help. "Please, adventurers, you must help me! My prized gryphon has broken free and is terrorizing Habit City! If you can stop her, I could reward you with some of her eggs!"',
    "Ruby": "The normally bustling peaks of the Stoïkalm Volcanoes lie silent in the snow. “I suppose the hikers and sight-seers are hibernating?” @gully says to you and @Aspiring_Advocate. “That makes our search easier.”<br><br>As you reach the summit, the chill wind merges with the steam billowing from the crater. “There!” @Aspiring_Advocate exclaims, pointing toward a hot spring. “What better place to find cool runes of Aquarius and passionate runes of Venus than where ice and fire meet?”<br><br>The three of you hurry toward the hot spring. “According to my research,” @Aspiring_Advocate says, “combining the runes with heart-shaped rubies will create a hatching potion that can foster friendship and love!”<br><br>Excited by the prospect of a new discovery, you all smile. “All right,” @gully says, “let's start searching!”",
    "Badger": "Ah, winter in the Taskwoods. The softly falling snow, the branches sparkling with frost, the Flourishing Fairies… still not snoozing?<br><br>“Why are they still awake?” cries @LilithofAlfheim. “If they don't hibernate soon, they'll never have the energy for planting season.”<br><br>As you and @Willow the Witty hurry to investigate, a furry head pops up from the ground. Before you can yell, “It’s the Badgering Bother!” it’s back in its burrow—but not before snatching up the Fairies' “Hibernate”  To Do's and dropping a giant list of pesky tasks in their place!<br><br>“No wonder the fairies aren't resting, if they're constantly being badgered like that!”  @plumilla says. Can you chase off this beast and save the Taskwood’s harvest this year?",
    "Unicorn": 'Conquest Creek has become muddied, destroying Habit City\'s fresh water supply! Luckily, @Lukreja knows an old legend that claims that a unicorn\'s horn can purify the foulest of waters. Together with your intrepid guide @UncommonCriminal, you hike through the frozen peaks of the Meandering Mountains. Finally, at the icy summit of Mount Habitica itself, you find the Unicorn Queen amid the glittering snows. "Your pleas are compelling," she tells you. "But first you must prove that you are worthy of my aid!"',
    "DilatoryDistress2": 'The siege can be seen from miles away: thousands of disembodied skulls rushing through a portal in the crevasse walls and making their way towards Dilatory.<br><br>When you meet King Manta in his war room, his eyes seem sunken, and his face is worried. "My daughter Adva disappeared into the Dark Crevasse just before this siege began. Please find her and bring her back home safely! I will lend you my Fire Coral Circlet to aid you. If you succeed, it is yours."',
    "Hedgehog": "Hedgehogs are a funny group of animals. They are some of the most affectionate pets a Habiteer could own. But rumor has it, if you feed them milk after midnight, they grow quite irritable. And fifty times their size. And <strong>InspectorCaracal</strong> did just that. Oops.",
    "Snail": 'You\'re excited to begin questing in the abandoned Dungeons of Drudgery, but as soon as you enter, you feel the ground under your feet start to suck at your boots. You look up to the path ahead and see Habiticans mired in slime. @Overomega yells, "They have too many unimportant tasks and dailies, and they\'re getting stuck on things that don\'t matter! Pull them out!"<br><br>"You need to find the source of the ooze," @Pfeffernusse agrees, "or the tasks that they cannot accomplish will drag them down forever!"<br><br>Pulling out your weapon, you wade through the gooey mud.... and encounter the fearsome Snail of Drudgery Sludge.',
    "Owl": "The Tavern light is lit 'til dawn<br>Until one eve the glow is gone!<br>How can we see for our all-nighters?<br>@Twitching cries, \"I need some fighters!<br>See that Night-Owl, starry foe?<br>Fight with haste and do not slow!<br>We'll drive its shadow from our door,<br>And make the night shine bright once more!\"",
    "Beetle": "Something in the domain of Habitica has gone awry. The Blacksmiths' forges have extinguished, and strange errors are appearing everywhere. With an ominous tremor, an insidious foe worms from the earth... a CRITICAL BUG! You brace yourself as it infects the land, and glitches begin to overtake the Habiticans around you. @starsystemic yells, \"We need to help the Blacksmiths get this Bug under control!\" It looks like you'll have to make this programmer's pest your top priority.",
    "Nudibranch": 'You finally get around to checking your To Do\'s on a lazy day in Habitica. Bright against your deepest red tasks are a gaggle of vibrant blue sea slugs. You are entranced! Their sapphire colors make your most intimidating tasks look as easy as your best Habits. In a feverish stupor you get to work, tackling one task after the other in a ceaseless frenzy...<br><br>The next thing you know, @LilithofAlfheim is pouring cold water over you. “The NowDo Nudibranchs have been stinging you all over! You need to take a break!”<br><br>Shocked, you see that your skin is as bright red as your To Do list was. "Being productive is one thing," @beffymaroo says, "but you\'ve also got to take care of yourself. Hurry, let\'s get rid of them!"',
    "Yarn": 'It’s such a pleasant day that you decide to take a walk through the Taskan Countryside. As you pass by its famous yarn shop, a piercing scream startles the birds into flight and scatters the butterflies into hiding. You run towards the source and see @Arcosine running up the path towards you. Behind him, a horrifying creature consisting of yarn, pins, and knitting needles is clicking and clacking ever closer.<br><br>The shopkeepers race after him, and @stefalupagus grabs your arm, out of breath. "Looks like all of his unfinished projects" <em>gasp gasp</em> "have transformed the yarn from our Yarn Shop" <em>gasp gasp</em> "into a tangled mass of Yarnghetti!"<br><br>"Sometimes, life gets in the way and a project is abandoned, becoming ever more tangled and confused," says @khdarkwolf. "The confusion can even spread to other projects, until there are so many half-finished works running around that no one gets anything done!"<br><br>It’s time to make a choice: complete your stalled projects… or decide to unravel them for good. Either way, you\'ll have to increase your productivity quickly before the Dread Yarnghetti spreads confusion and discord to the rest of Habitica!',
    "Peacock": 'You trek through the Taskwoods, wondering which of the enticing new goals you should pick. As you go deeper into the forest, you realize that you\'re not alone in your indecision. "I could learn a new language, or go to the gym..." @Cecily Perez mutters. "I could sleep more," muses @Lilith of Alfheim, "or spend time with my friends..." It looks like @PainterProphet, @Pfeffernusse, and @Draayder are equally paralyzed by the overwhelming options.<br><br>You realize that these ever-more-demanding feelings aren\'t really your own... you\'ve stumbled straight into the trap of the pernicious Push-and-Pull Peacock! Before you can run, it leaps from the bushes. With each head pulling you in conflicting directions, you start to feel burnout overcoming you. You can\'t defeat both foes at once, so you only have one option -- concentrate on the nearest task to fight back!',
    "LostMasterclasser3": "As night unfurls over the scorching sands of the Timewastes, your guides @AnnDeLune, @Kiwibot, and @Katy133 lead you forward. Some bleached pillars poke from the shadowed dunes, and as you approach them, a strange skittering sound echoes across the seemingly-abandoned expanse.<br><br>“Invisible creatures!” says the April Fool, clearly covetous. “Oho! Just imagine the possibilities. This must be the work of a truly stealthy Rogue.”<br><br>“A Rogue who could be watching us,” says Lady Glaciate, dismounting and raising her spear. “If there’s a head-on attack, try not to irritate our opponent. I don’t want a repeat of the volcano incident.”<br><br>He beams at her. “But it was one of your most resplendent rescues.”<br><br>To your surprise, Lady Glaciate turns very pink at the compliment. She hastily stomps away to examine the ruins.<br><br>“Looks like the wreck of an ancient city,” says @AnnDeLune. “I wonder what…”<br><br>Before she can finish her sentence, a portal roars open in the sky. Wasn’t that magic supposed to be nearly impossible here? The hoofbeats of the invisible animals thunder as they flee in panic, and you steady yourself against the onslaught of shrieking skulls that flood the skies.",
    "Pterodactyl": 'You\'re taking a stroll along the peaceful Stoïkalm Cliffs when an evil screech rends the air. You turn to find a hideous creature flying towards you and are overcome by a powerful terror. As you turn to flee, @Lilith of Alfheim grabs you. "Don\'t panic! It\'s just a Pterror-dactyl."<br><br>@Procyon P nods. "They nest nearby, but they\'re attracted to the scent of negative Habits and undone Dailies."<br><br>"Don\'t worry," @Katy133 says. "We just need to be extra productive to defeat it!" You are filled with a renewed sense of purpose and turn to face your foe.',
    "Alligator": "“Crikey!” exclaims @gully. “An Insta-Gator in its natural habitat! Careful, it distracts its prey with things that seem urgent THIS INSTANT, and it feeds on the unchecked Dailies that result.” You fall silent to avoid attracting its attention, but to no avail. The Insta-Gator spots you and charges! Distracting voices rise up from Swamps of Stagnation, grabbing for your attention: “Read this post! See this photo! Pay attention to me THIS INSTANT!” You scramble to mount a counterattack, completing your Dailies and bolstering your good Habits to fight off the dreaded Insta-Gator.",
    "Butterfly": "Your gardener friend @Megan sends you an invitation: “These warm days are the perfect time to visit Habitica’s butterfly garden in the Taskan countryside. Come see the butterflies migrate!” When you arrive, however, the garden is in shambles -- little more than scorched grass and dried-out weeds. It’s been so hot that the Habiticans haven’t come out to water the flowers, and the dark-red Dailies have turned it into a dry, sun-baked, fire-hazard. There's only one butterfly there, and there's something odd about it...<br><br>“Oh no! This is the perfect hatching ground for the Flaming Butterfry,” cries @Leephon.<br><br>“If we don’t catch it, it’ll destroy everything!” gasps @Eevachu.<br><br>Time to say bye, bye to Butterfry!",
    "Amber": "You’re sitting in the Tavern with @beffymaroo and @-Tyr- when @Vikte bursts through the door and excitedly tells you about the rumors of another type of Magic Hatching Potion hidden in the Taskwoods. Having completed your Dailies, the three of you immediately agree to help @Vikte on their search. After all, what’s the harm in a little adventure?<br><br>After walking through the Taskwoods for hours, you’re beginning to regret joining such a wild chase. You’re about to head home, when you hear a surprised yelp and turn to see a huge lizard with shiny amber scales coiled around a tree, clutching @Vikte in her claws. @beffymaroo reaches for her sword.<br><br>“Wait!” cries @-Tyr-. “It’s the Trerezin! She’s not dangerous, just dangerously clingy!”",
    "Sheep": 'As you wander the rural Taskan countryside with friends, taking a "quick break" from your obligations, you find a cozy yarn shop. You are so absorbed in your procrastination that you hardly notice the ominous clouds creep over the horizon. "I\'ve got a ba-a-a-ad feeling about this weather," mutters @Misceo, and you look up. The stormy clouds are swirling together, and they look a lot like a... "We don\'t have time for cloud-gazing!" @starsystemic shouts. "It\'s attacking!" The Thunder Ram hurtles forward, slinging bolts of lightning right at you!',
    "Robot": "At Max Capacity labs, @Rev is putting the finishing touches on their newest invention, a robotic Accountability Buddy, when a strange metal vehicle suddenly appears in a plume of smoke, inches from the robot’s Fluctuation Detector! Its occupants, two strange figures dressed in silver, emerge and remove their space helmets, revealing themselves as @FolleMente and @McCoyly.<br><br>“I hypothesize that there was an anomaly in our productivity implementation,” @FolleMente says sheepishly.<br><br>@McCoyly crosses her arms. “That means they neglected to complete their Dailies, which I postulate led to the disintegration of our Productivity Stabilizer. It’s an essential component to time travel that needs consistency to work properly. Our accomplishments power our movement through time and space! I don’t have time to explain further, @Rev. You’ll discover it in 37 years, or perhaps your allies the Mysterious Time Travelers can fill you in. For now, can you help us fix our time machine?”",
    "Turtle": 'Help! This giant sea turtle cannot find her way to her nesting beach. She returns there every year to lay her eggs, but this year Inkomplete Bay is filled with toxic Task Flotsam made of red Dailies and unchecked To Do\'s.

She turns to you and says, "I am sorry. I have been a fool, with a head too big to see how cruel I have been. But my father is crueler than I could ever be. If he isn\'t stopped he\'ll destroy us all. Here, use my morningstar and halt the Iron Knight!"',
    "Sabretooth": "A roaring monster is terrorizing Habitica! The creature stalks through the wilds and woods, then bursts forth to attack before vanishing again. It's been hunting innocent pandas and frightening the flying pigs into fleeing their pens to roost in the trees. @InspectorCaracal and @icefelis explain that the Zombie Sabre Cat was set free while they were excavating in the ancient, untouched ice-fields of the Stoïkalm Steppes. \"It was perfectly friendly at first – I don't know what happened. Please, you have to help us recapture it! Only a champion of Habitica can subdue this prehistoric beast!\"",
